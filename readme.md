# Project Overview

In this project, we will be creating a class to handle fixed-point numbers, a valuable type often missing from most programming languages. We'll follow the Orthodox Canonical Form and implement various member functions to manipulate and work with these numbers.

# Significance and Relevance

This project is significant for understanding and implementing fixed-point numbers, which find applications in computer graphics, sound processing, and scientific programming. It also reinforces concepts of ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and adhering to the Orthodox Canonical class form.

# Key Concepts in Focus

- Fixed-point numbers
- Orthodox Canonical Form
- Operator overloading
- Ad-hoc polymorphism

## Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form

### Introduction:

In this exercise, we will create a class representing a fixed-point number. This class will adhere to the Orthodox Canonical Form and include essential member functions like constructors, destructor, and raw value access.

### Relevance:

This exercise introduces the concept of fixed-point numbers and reinforces the implementation of the Orthodox Canonical Form for C++ classes.

### Key Concepts:

- Orthodox Canonical Form
- Constructors and destructors
- Member functions

### How to Run:

1. Compile
```bash
makerun
```
2. Observe the output to verify that the class functions correctly.

## Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class

### Introduction:

In this exercise, we enhance the fixed-point number class to handle different types of input (integers and floating-point numbers). We also add member functions to convert fixed-point numbers to floats or integers.

### Relevance:

This exercise builds on the previous one by extending the functionality of the fixed-point number class, making it more versatile and useful in various contexts.

### Key Concepts:

- Constructors with parameters
- Conversion functions
- Operator overloading (insertion operator)

### How to Run:

1. Compile
```bash
makerun
```

2. Check the output to ensure the class handles different input types correctly.

## Exercise 02: Now we’re talking

### Introduction:

In this exercise, we further expand the capabilities of the fixed-point number class by overloading comparison and arithmetic operators. We also implement increment and decrement operators.

### Relevance:

This exercise emphasizes operator overloading and polymorphism, showcasing how fixed-point numbers can be used in arithmetic and comparisons.

### Key Concepts:

- Operator overloading
- Polymorphism
- Increment and decrement operators

### How to Run:

1. Compile with 
```bash
makerun
```
2. Review the output to verify that the overloaded operators work as expected.

## Exercise 03: BSP

### Introduction:

In this exercise, we implement a function to determine whether a given point lies inside a triangle. This involves using fixed-point numbers and basic geometry concepts.

### Relevance:

This exercise applies the knowledge gained in the previous exercises to solve a practical problem related to binary space partitioning.

### Key Concepts:

- Binary space partitioning
- Geometry and points

### How to Run:

1. Compile
```bash
makerun
```

2. Verify the output to ensure the function accurately determines if a point is inside a triangle.

# Conclusion

This project has provided a comprehensive understanding of fixed-point numbers, operator overloading, and adhering to the Orthodox Canonical class form. By completing the exercises, we have gained valuable insights into these fundamental concepts in C++ programming.
